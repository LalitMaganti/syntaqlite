Goal: to build a suite of tools called syntaqlite.

For the V0:
1) libsyntaqlite-tokenize: a tokenizer for SQLite SQL based on SQLite code
2) libsyntaqlite-ast: a parser for SQLite SQL capable of generating an AST
   based on lemon generated code. Based on libsyntaqlite-tokenize.
3) libsyntaqlite-fmt: a formatter for SQlite SQL based on libsyntaqlite-ast.
3) syntaqlite-fmt: a command line frontend for libsyntaqlite-fmt.
4) syntaqlite.com (placeholder name): A WASM playground where you can paste a
   SQLtie SQL query and it will show you tokens, parse tree, formatted SQL.
   Based on all libraries above

Post V0:
1) syntaqlite-lsp: LSP implementation for editor integration built on
   libsyntaqlite-ast.
2) syntaqlite-vscode: a VSCode plugin built on top of sytaqlite-lsp.
3) libsyntaqlite-lint: a linter built on top of libsyntaqlite-ast.
4) syntaqlite-lint: command line frontend for libsyntaqlite-lint

The main goals of the project are:
* portable: written in plain C so usable in exactly same places as SQLite itself
* fast: very high performance capable of working with very large files
  including huge autogenerated files
* accurate: uses same functions and tools as SQLite so 100% compatible with
  what SQLite itself accepts.

Non goals:
* We will never support another SQL dialect. We're not looking to build a
  generic SQL parsing framework.
